# Left-to-Right-Calculator

The program will process user inputted arithmatic math problems that are entered in a left to right format.
This program will follow good C++ programming practices as well as the "SOLID" principles 

## To-Do
These listings will be implemented and fulfilled in coming iterations.
```
- Contructors and destructors for calculators
- Use a function that creates and destroys only the necessary calculator(s) to replace DualCalculator or at least the functionality
- Provide live calculations as the math problem is inputted
- Use the "curses" library to make the live updates look nicer
- Provide releases as executables and buildable packages
- Update README.md to provide a link for the SOLID principles
- Update README.md to include image examples
```
